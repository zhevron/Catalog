Catalog - Dungeon and raid loot catalog
====================================================

## What is Catalog?

Catalog is a WildStar addon that catalogs loot from bosses in all types of group content.
The browser lets you look through the loot to see where you can get upgrades.

## How do I use it?

You can install the addon from Curse using either the website or the Curse client.
After the addon has been installed, you can open the browser by typing '/loot' or '/catalog' in the chat.

## I found a error in the loot tables. Now what?

Please report any errors in the loot tables as a Github issue [here](https://github.com/zhevron/Catalog/issues).

## I found a bug. How do I report it?

Please report any bugs as a Github issue [here](https://github.com/zhevron/Catalog/issues).

## I want to contribute to the addon. How do I start?

The easiest way to contribute to the addon is to run the [Jabbithole client](http://www.jabbithole.com/pages/client) and/or the [WildHeap client](https://www.wildheap.com/client). Catalog exports it's database from [Jabbithole](http://www.jabbithole.com) and [WildHeap](https://www.wildheap.com) and by providing data for them, you are helping to keep the loot tables accurate.
